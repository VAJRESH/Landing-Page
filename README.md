## Thoughts
- I am using bootstrap extensively(don't like to use libraries much) but it was great experience and it increased my speed exponentially.
- I am using SCSS for the first time and it is also awesome. Its definitely worth learning and using.

## Progress
- Started the project in the morning around 08:30 on 7 May, 2021.
- Created a README file and added tasks and finalized the prototype for the website.
- Installed SASS and got an overview of it from [official doc](https://sass-lang.com/guide).
- Created index.html with [Starter template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template) of bootstrap 5.
- Header contains bootstrap navbar, form and custom hero section. This make the first part of the page complete <!-- Time: 13:00 -->
